Go to the https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps to create a reddit app, click on create another app. If you want, use this tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FpqXyJsd1s, starting at minute 3:33, to have a guideline on how to acces the Id and secret. After creating the app in the page, copy and paste the Secret and Id into the main.py script.
